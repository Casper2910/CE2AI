1. What is the difference between AI, ML, and deep learning?

AI is the broad field focused on making machines behave intelligently.

ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses multi-layer neural networks to learn complex patterns, especially in images, speech, and text.


2. What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a technique where algorithms learn relationships and patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.


3. What is the primary difference between unsupervised and supervised machine learning?

Supervised learning uses labeled data (inputs + known outputs). Labels are used for the models traning of classification.

Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data and discovers structure or patterns on its own. Clustering is a common output of unsupervised learning but model is not able to classify clusters and can only group simmilar data.


4. What is reinforcement learning?
Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm where an agent interacts with an environment and learns by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.


5. What types of problems can machine learning solve well when compared to traditional programming?

Problems with complex patterns (e.g., image recognition or advance robot movement in real world schenarios)

Problems where rules are hard to define explicitly (e.g., spam detection, object detection)

Problems that require adaptation over time (e.g., recommendation systems)


6. What types of problems can you solve with unsupervised machine learning?

Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation)

Dimensionality reduction (e.g., data compression, visualization)

Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud or sensor fault detection)


7. What types of problems can you solve with supervised machine learning?

Classification (e.g., email spam vs. not spam)

Regression (e.g., house price prediction)

Forecasting (e.g., demand or sales prediction)


8.  Explain the difference between a ML algorithm and a ML model?

An ML algorithm is the learning procedure (e.g., linear regression, decision tree).

An ML model is the result of applying that algorithm to data (the trained parameters).


9. List some of the challenges of machine learning and provide concrete examples?

Data quality: Noisy or missing data → inaccurate predictions (e.g., incomplete customer records).

Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data (e.g., memorizing instead of generalizing).

Bias: Biased data leads to biased outcomes (e.g., unfair loan approvals).

Scalability: Algorithms may not handle large datasets efficiently (e.g., slow training on big data).

Interpretability: Complex models are hard to explain (e.g., deep neural networks in healthcare).
